## 🌐 Overview

Urban cities generate massive amounts of municipal waste every day. Traditional waste management systems rely heavily on **manual monitoring and fixed garbage collection routes**, which often results in overflowing bins, inefficient waste collection, and increased environmental pollution.

The **AI-Driven Circular Waste Intelligence System** introduces a **data-driven smart waste ecosystem** that automatically monitors bins, classifies waste, and optimizes garbage collection operations.

This platform integrates:

- IoT smart bins with multiple sensors
- AI-based waste classification using computer vision
- Real-time telemetry using MQTT and REST APIs
- Cloud backend for data processing and storage
- Route optimization algorithms for garbage trucks
- Municipal monitoring dashboard

---

## ⚠️ Problem Statement

Urban waste management systems face several critical challenges:

- Lack of waste segregation at the source
- Overflowing garbage bins in public areas
- Fixed garbage collection routes regardless of bin status
- High operational and fuel costs
- Increased landfill waste and environmental pollution

Without intelligent monitoring systems, municipal authorities cannot make **real-time, data-driven decisions**, leading to inefficient waste management operations.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

The proposed system introduces a **smart circular waste intelligence platform** powered by **Artificial Intelligence and Internet of Things (IoT)** technologies, transforming traditional waste management into an **automated, intelligent, and data-driven process**.

### Key Features

- Smart waste bins with multiple environmental sensors
- AI-based waste classification using camera and YOLO model
- Real-time telemetry using MQTT protocol
- Cloud backend for data ingestion and processing
- Intelligent garbage truck route optimization
- Municipal monitoring dashboard for city operators
- Simulation tools for testing the system without physical hardware

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The system consists of **eight interconnected layers** — from citizen interaction at the bin level, all the way to cloud processing, dashboard monitoring, and citizen incentives.

### Architecture Overview

### 1. Smart Waste Bin (IoT Device)

Smart bins use sensors and microcontrollers to monitor bin status.

| Sensor | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Ultrasonic Sensor | Bin fill level |
| Load Cell + HX711 | Waste weight |
| IR Sensor | Waste insertion detection |
| MQ135 | Gas detection |
| DHT11 | Temperature & humidity |

Firmware runs on **ESP32**, sending telemetry to the backend.

---

### 2. Edge AI Waste Classification

A **Raspberry Pi camera module** captures images of disposed waste. Images are processed using **YOLOv8 computer vision model** to classify waste types:

- Plastic
- Paper
- Metal
- Organic
- Hazardous

Classification results are sent to the backend.

---

### 3. Cloud Backend

The backend is built using **FastAPI** and handles:

- Receiving sensor telemetry from bins
- Storing data in PostgreSQL database
- Triggering alerts when bins are full or gas levels are high
- Storing waste classification results
- Computing optimal garbage truck routes

---

### 4. Route Optimization System

The backend uses **graph-based shortest path algorithms** to calculate optimized routes for garbage trucks — only visiting bins that require collection.

**Endpoint:**
```
POST /routes/optimize
```

**Returns:**
- List of bins requiring pickup
- Optimized route order
- Estimated travel distance

---

### 5. Monitoring Dashboard

A municipal web dashboard visualizes:

- Smart bin locations
- Waste fill levels
- Waste classification statistics
- Garbage truck positions
- Alerts and notifications

---
